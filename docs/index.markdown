Hello, there. I am but a wanderer. I travel from village to village with a pot and this magic stone. (holds up a rock) When I arrive at even the poorest of hamlets I start my pot aboil, this stone its only ingredient. It's not long before another arrives to ask about my pot of boiling water. "You mean my magic stone soup! It would be better with a bit of cabbage," I say. "Oh, I don't have any of that but we do have some carrots," they say. Before long, the whole village is enjoying a stew of vegetables and mushrooms and tofu. My life is a metaphor. I'm told Magic Stone is doing the same but with software. It would be much better with an Issue. Perhaps you can spare a Pull Request?

And now a message from our sponsor:

> Social networks should not create conflict and isolation in the pursuit of profits. My ideal social network supports communication, health, joy and kindness. It is a place that makes my life richer, more interesting and fun because of the people I get to know. This disconnect between reality and ideal is why I am working on the open source fediverse. I can't pinpoint what a good social network is but I am excited by the unknown and the quest for that better experience. Magic Stone is an idea, a space, and a collection of projects to help build social networking for humans.
