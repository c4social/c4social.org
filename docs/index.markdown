# Creating magic through evolution of the Fediverse

We want to see decentralized social media flourish. For that to happen, we need more people to get involved in improving what we're already using and to start new projects as well. C4Social is applying a novel development model so that everyone can contribute their strengths to grow software along with the community.

# Other things to know

We just started in August 2021 so everything is very new and there are just a few of us involved so stay tuned and get in touch if you like early-stage projects.

Our critical need for bootstrapping is for maintainers who can check in on pull requests a few times a week. If you're interested, ping David Sterry on [Mastodon](https://c4.social/@weex) or [diaspora](https://dogieda.org/people/43937430e739013980160242ac120005)
