# Creating magic through evolution of the Fediverse

Our primary goal is to accelerate the development of decentralized social media. A novel development model  helps reduce bureaucracy so that contributors can do what they love and software can adapt quickly to community needs.

# How can I help?

* Try out the software and report any problems you find. A list of instances is available below. Each app has a link in the footer or sidebar to report issues.
* Contribute by making a pull request. Documentation can be edited and submitted entirely on GitHub, though you are welcome to edit elsewhere and to commit changes by using Git.
* Become a maintainer. No software development experience is necessary. Simply agree to the rules and have an hour or two available each week. No meetings required.
* Start a new project. If you have an idea for federated free/libre and open source software, we can help you get your project going, whether it involves forking existing software or creating something brand new.
