## Ecko Features

<h3 id="posts">Longer posts</h3>

Posts, or toots, are limited to 500 characters by default but in Ecko this limit can be easily modified in the Administration settings.

<h3 id="poll">More poll choices</h3>

Polls are limited to 4 options by default but in Ecko more poll options can be allowed via Administration settings.

<h3 id="local">Local-only posts</h3>

Ecko enables users to limit toots to be local-only. This can create a more intimate feel for a community. This facilitates community-only events with high volume discussion that might otherwise inundate followers outside the instance.

<h3 id="favicon">Easy favicon upload</h3>

Administrators can upload a favicon from the Administration settings.

<h3 id="undescribed">Highlights undescribed media</h3>

For accessibility, images should be acommpanied by descriptive alt text. Ecko includes two themes that highlight media without this metadata, thereby helping users be more inclusive citizens of the network.

<h3 id="blocklist">Blocklist import/export</h3>

Blocklists are used to protect users from harassment and abuse. Administrators can import and export CSV blocklists from Federation settings.

<h3 id="yunohost">Yunohost support</h3>

Yunohost is the easiest way to self-host many free and open source web applications. Ecko is available in the YunoHost application library.
