# c4social.org

Use this repo to submit problems for the Community, which are not specific to any one software project.

Since it requires a pull request flow to update, we want to keep the Jekyll-based website minimal. Besides introductory material it should have links to where it's easy for the community to contribute. For example the [wiki](https://github.com/c4social/c4social.org/wiki), issue trackers, and [discussion forum](https://github.com/c4social/c4social.org/discussions). TODO: Incorporate feeds into the site to always display fresh content.

## Testing

1. Install Jekyll: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/

3. Go into c4social.org/docs: `cd c4social.org/docs`
4. `bundle exec jekyll serve`
5. Visit http://127.0.0.1:4000
