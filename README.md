# Magic Stone - meta and website

This repo contains the content displayed on the project home page.

Use this repo also to submit problems for the Community, which are not specific to any one software project.

Since it requires a pull request flow to update, we want to keep the Jekyll-based website minimal. Besides introductory material it should have links to where it's easy for the community to contribute. For example the [wiki](https://github.com/magicstone-dev/magicstone.dev/wiki), issue trackers, and [discussion forum](https://github.com/magicstone-dev/magicstone.dev/discussions).

## Testing

1. Install Jekyll: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/
2. Clone this repo.
3. Go into magicstone.dev/docs: `cd magicstone.dev/docs`
4. `bundle exec jekyll serve`
5. Visit http://127.0.0.1:4000
